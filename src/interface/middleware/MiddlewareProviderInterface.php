 * Middleware Provider Interface

 * when passed in.  The expected use case for this is if you want a controller to specify what middleware gets run when
 * it's invoked independent of any other middleware that may already be present in the stack.
 *
 * The usual rules on execution order apply to providers as apply to the middleware stack as a whole.
